# Fan-Speed-Controller

This tiny board regulates the speed of standard three-pin PC fans. Typically, three-pin fans are uncontrollable due to their constant voltage. Pulse Width Modulation (PWM) is used in 4 pin fans to regulate the fan speed.


making a PWM generator using a 555 timer, components, and potentiometer. This enables the fan's speed to be adjusted.

## Use Case

In areas where space is limited and low power is needed, this circuit uses four PC fans connected in parallel to give a low power solution for air circulation. This is what I designed for my own little grow space. Air circulation is essential to plants because it keeps stale air and moisture from building up, which could cause mould and other problems, and helps the plants acquire the carbon dioxide they require for photosynthesis.

Small fans, such as those used for computer cooling, are a perfect addition to the already-power-hungry heat and lighting systems. They can be mounted to shelves or utilized to move around the cramped space. Utilizing fans and power supplies that have been lying around and collecting dust is also helpful.
